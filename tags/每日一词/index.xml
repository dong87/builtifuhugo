      <description>First we discuss these other entries and then a benefit criterion for the orchard where different components and entries are amalgamated. (Lindgren, Prescher, 2005) When there is a mixture of the two types, as is the case with our example, the models can be formulated as an amalgamation of those presented for the individual types and so for brevity are not detailed here. (Cullis et al., 2014) These site types are, however, amalgamated into a single harvest volume genetic value for selection for breeding and deployment.</description>

      <description> The addition of other easily measurable traits could not considerably ameliorate model fit for juvenile MFA. (Lenz et al., 2013) An alternative to full-sib crossing and testing can ameliorate all these constraints. (Lambeth et al., 2001)  </description>

      <description>They play a significant role in local and global economies because of their amenability to large-scale plantations to produce wood, their role in landscape management, their rapid growth potential with low input (Parent et al., 2015) Members of the genus Populus are used as a model forest species for diverse studies not only because of their amenability to experimental and genetic manipulation, but also because of their high economic and ecological importance as the most widely cultivated tree throughout the northern hemisphere3,4.</description>

      <description> After seven cycles, however, the loss of genetic variance was abated compared to remaining methods. (Neyhart et al., 2017) The trend of increasing coancestry was somewhat abated at the highest paternity confidence (BP95, Table 3) as selection was constrained by the fewer number of assigned paternities (59%, Table 1).

      <description> The haplotype variance at a locus for the HAP_IBD models was calculated analogous to estimating the additive genetic variance in a polygenic model, relative to a base population of unrelated animals. (Calus et al., 2008) Definitions analogous to the inbreeding coefficient and the coancestry coefficient of individuals, in terms of the probability of genes being &amp;ldquo;identical by descent,&amp;rdquo; were developed for groups of individuals.

      <description> Adaptation potential is more complex to ascertain and is likely to vary significantly depending on several interacting factors (Aitken et al., 2008). (Parent et al., 2015) It then remains to ascertain which combination(s) of assessment ages would give the optimal value of t:. (Burdon, 1989) To ascertain GS&amp;rsquo;s impact on gains per unit time, Schaeffer (2006) suggested a plan for implementing GS into a dairy breeding program.

      <description>Our results are somewhat at odds with theirs. (Excoffier, Smouse, Quattro, 1992) However, these low estimates of dominance variance in the -O progeny are somewhat at odds with the inbreeding de pression evident in the S progeny (discussed later). (Griffin, Cotterill, 1988) Such a finding appears to be at odds with genome evolution theory as presented by authors such as Lynch (2007) but may be explained in part by the rather large number of pseudogenes; for example, Garca-Gil (2008) found that pseudogenes were much more numerous than intact coding genes in the case of the phytochrome gene family in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris).</description>

      <description>More specifically, the intercept is driven toward lower values; the positive slope associated with visual acuity at baseline, visual0, is further increased; the negative slope associated with time is brought closer to zero; and the treatment effect is attenuated. Yet, these events were attenuated at age 6, in which case Squillace&amp;rsquo;s (1974) procedure was effective for reducing the bias in the h^ 2op. In this study, we have found that cold response in Arabidopsis is attenuated by the proteasome pathway.</description>

      <description> This issue needs to be addressed if the full value of genomic technology and resources is to be brought to bear on crucial problems in forest management. (Neale, Kremer, 2011) Rational approaches can be used to recover missing values when there are redundancies in the data or when external information can be brought to bear on the problem.

      <description>Estimates of covariance between traits were derived using vari- ance estimates of each pair of traits and of their sum by analogy with x ,y = 1 2 (x2+ y - x2 - y2 ). (Fries, Ericsson, 1998) Our model (Equation 1) does not assume that interaction among kin differs from that among non-kin, although the model extends by analogy to incorporate that phenomenon; see the discussion.] (Bijma, Muir, Van Arendonk, 2007) By analogy it was easily observed that the control of the number of factors was required for the control of the expected prediction error by the fitted model.</description>

      <description>Given that both coastal and Guanaja provenances have important traits that could be infused into the MPR breeding population by way of inter-provenance hybridization, maintenance of these populations as separate sublines within the breeding population as suggested by Kanowski &amp;amp; Nikles (1989), still seems to be warranted. (Johnston et al., 2003) Second, we shall illustrate by way of a simple example, that use of a prediction that is conditional on the lack of fit term often suffers from the problem that it comprises a mixture of predictability status of the effects.</description>

      <description>In particular, functional mapping capitalizes on statistical modeling of the covariance structure based on autoregressive (AR) and structured antedependence (SAD) processes and, thus, makes a longitudinal high-dimensional problem computationally tractable. (Wu, Yang, Wu, 2007) Linkage disequilibrium mapping capitalizes on historical recombination and can be used both to determine whether candidate genes are associated with variation in a behaviour in a natural population and to identify polymorphisms that contribute to this variation24.</description>

      <description>To circumvent this issue, it has been proposed to reduce effective population size of the targeted populations in order to increase linkage disequilibrium between markers and QTLs and capture most of the QTLs, a strategy generally known as genomic selection [73-75]. (Prunier et al., 2013) To circumvent the difficulty in manipulating a large number of correlated traits, new attempts were made by Mangin et al. (1998) and Korol et al.</description>

      <description> This collation gives a more general view of genetic parameters than a single parameter estimate for a single trait from data for a specific population at a given point in time. (Kroon et al., 2011) We thank the BSES Limited Plant Improvement technicians who contributed to the production, collection and collation of the data used in this study.

      <description>After this period (i.e., 70 days), the temperature regime in the germination cabinet was changed to follow that recommended by the ISTA and germination commenced after five days for the majority of the clones (i.e., four days sooner than that observed for the previous test). (El-Kassaby, 1999) Each of these growth models has a common feature that the development of ontogenetic trajectory is regulated by a set of &amp;ldquo;control parameters&amp;rdquo; such as onset age of growth, offset signal for growth, growth rate during the period of growth, and initial size at the commencement of the growth period.</description>

      <description> Heterosis, whether between crosses of varieties or inbred lines, is observed in maize, but the genetic basis of observed heterosis is still conjectural (Coors and Pandey, 1999). (Hallauer et al., 2010) Given this information, it is reasonable to conjecture that the resin yielding ability of loblolly pines can be drastically changed in both positive and negative directions through a program of selective breeding.

      <description>Serial cutting propagation means that clones are produced in consecutive propagation cycles, where a new round of cuttings are taken from the previously rooted cuttings, etc. (Truta et al., 2010) An additional random term was introduced in trial 3 to model distinct jumps in plot yields between sets of consecutive plots within columns (described as &amp;lsquo;small blocks&amp;rsquo;). (Welham et al., 2010) Auinger et al. 4 recently found that aggregating data from several consecutive cycles connected by a sufficient number of common ancestors improves the accuracy of the predictions of candidate genotypes.</description>

      <description>The subgenus Archaeotityus presents several conspicuous diagnostic characters, and all of its species are morphologically very similar (Louren, 1999, 2006). (Ojanguren-Affilastro et al., 2017) Continuous phase transitions take place gradually with a less conspicuous change, but they may play a distinct role in assisting an organism to adjust its growth form in a precise quantitative way to best adapt to environmental perturbations (Huijser &amp;amp; Schmid, 2011). (Xu et al., 2016) A more conspicuous consequence of poorly adapted genotypes might be reduced growth rates of adult trees.</description>

      <description> One possibly contentious issue is the choice between fixed and random effects in the analysis. The choice of appropriate prior distributions is a contentious issue in Bayesian inference, especially when these priors are supposed to convey vague initial knowledge. (Sorensen et al., 1994) Historically, however, the most contentious question has concerned whether major genes play a major role in species differences. (SLATE, 2004)  </description>

      <description>A corollary is that obtaining GS model accuracy beyond that of pedigree-based models would likely necessitate increasing genome coverage by a factor of at least 10X to 100X of that used herein, resulting in the use of a very large number of markers, likely in the hundreds of thousands. In parallel, inbreeding experiments have been conducted as a corollary with an interpretation as being the opposing effect of heterosis. A corollary of this problem is that lack of dynamic consistency makes any kind of individual differences analysis uninterpretable.</description>

      <description>Adverse genetic correlations can curtail breeding progress as, for example, a negative genetic correlation between growth and wood density would make it more difficult to select concurrently for improvement in both traits. (Costa e Silva et al., 2008) The review effectively curtailed the breeding activities in the public sector, especially of the major crops. (Acquaah, 2012) While hybrids are less utilized in more temperate zones, eucalypt hybridization programs involving controlled crossing were undertaken early in countries such as Russia and France, but hybrid development was curtailed by extreme frosts.</description>

(Luikart et al., 2003) Finally, sterility will help curb genetic pollution.

      <description>However, diameter growth, and hence basal area growth, are subject to competitive influences, which can either dampen or accentuate provenance differences depending on plot sizes or presence-absence of surround plantings. (Burdon, Low, 1991) Mature tree hybrid experiment results were similar to those of the seedling experiment, but with a dampening of differences caused by low nutrient availability and possibly age effects. (El-Kassaby, Lindgren, 2007) Even if initial survival is poor in one year the effects are damped down by the fact that one year’s planting is not normally a discrete crop with respect to felling plans.</description>

      <description>Generally, adverse genetic correlations have been reported between growth and wood properties (Loo et al. 1984; Williams and Megraw 1994; Cumbie 2002; Hannrup et al.2004; Li et al. 2007), indicating that selecting parents for growth probably will be to the detriment of wood quality and vice versa. (Antony et al., 2014) Competition, a detrimental fitness effect from other individuals, is one such associative effect, where the contribution from conspecifics is to lower fitness.</description>

      <description>Environments are deemed to be a random effect, as they were chosen to represent a roughly random sample of a population of environments. (Klisz et al., 2017) If GEI is deemed to be negligible, then selected genotypes could be used for plantations to produce uniform wood under different environmental conditions (e.g. (Gapare et al., 2010) The candidate models should include all covariance structures deemed to be scientifically plausible in the context of the data being analyzed.</description>

      <description> Since pedigree errors reduce rates of genetic gain, the ability to correct pedigree mistakes is a virtually zero cost dividend of genomic selection programs. (Weller, 2015) On the other hand, application of the additive genetic model in selective breeding of livestock has produced remarkable dividends, as shown in Dekkers and Hospital (2002).

      <description>Although diallel designs are difficult with forest trees, because of the problems of quickly completing all possible combinations of control crosses, they have been attempted by several workers (2, 3, 23, 107, 156). (Libby, Stettler, Seitz, 1969) Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and gene iso-lation are significantly more difficult with large genomes. (Neale et al., 1994) Accurate estimation of relatedness requires many marker loci and is, therefore, difficult with microsatellites.</description>

      <description>HAL is a multi-disciplinary open access archive for the deposit and dissemination of scientific research documents, whether they are published or not. (Cappa, Yanchuk, Cartwright, 2012) A regular selection program based on additive genetic performance will normally result in a comparable genetic improvement after a short period of repeated selection, and may then continue beyond the results obtained in the present cross experiment without the complications caused by the laborious dissemination procedures required by a crossbreeding program and the problems caused by a possibly increased environmental sensitivity in the hybrids.</description>

      <description>We discuss these considerations and additionally emphasize the utility of supplemental nongenetic data for increasing the efficacy of pedigree analysis. (Wilson, Ferguson, 2002) This patch size is entirely dependent on the efficacy of the global trend model. (Dutkowski et al., 2006) Support is also provided by a selection experiment designed to assess the efficacy of directional selection as a means to improve resin production in P. elliottii.

      <description> However, one should also be aware that QTL mapping studies for disease resistance traits frequently entail interspecies hybrid crosses. (Hall, Hallingback, Wu, 2016) At the other extreme, pedigree data also entail real challenges. (Cantor, Lange, Sinsheimer, 2010) Shifts in elevation also entail adaptation, which might occur more readily, because the proximity of populations facilitates gene migration.

      <description>This focus is expanding now to include more routine evaluations of physical and chemical wood components in light of the escalating interest in Populus biomass energy feedstock and the advent of increasingly affordable and reliable assessment methods. (Hidalgo et al., 2010) In addition, as climate change escalates, reduced methane emissions from cattle and sheep will be a critical goal. (Hayes, Lewin, Goddard, 2013) These concurrent escalations have resulted in the challenge of analyzing larger and larger data sets using more and more complex methods.</description>

      <description>For a more detailed exposition of the theory of LMMs, the reader is referred to the monographs by, e.g., Searle et al. (Casella, Fienberg, Olkin, 2013) For simplicity of exposition, some of our equations consider the case of a single block of plots, but extension to several blocks is straightforward and is, in fact, used in the examples. (Piepho, Richter, Williams, 2008) Nevertheless, we also explain all main results and techniques in verbal form, such that practitioners who do not want to study the mathematics in all detail can follow the exposition.</description>

      <description>As the vast majority of studies shows that deleterious recessive alleles, not overdominant alleles, are most important in causing ID (Crow 1993; Ritland 1996); selfing greatly increases the chance for these alleles to form homozygotes and, therefore, to be exposed to selection. (Wang, Hagqvist, Tigerstedt, 1999) An attempt was made in eqs. 8 and 9 to derive average relatedness of the gene pool of the seed crop when the orchard is exposed to pollen contamination.</description>

      <description>Researchers interested in explaining the relationship may prefer a more manual variable selection approach that takes into account background information and is geared toward the substantive questions of interest. (Faraway, 2006) In addition, methods for estimating genomic relationships and predicting genetic values from SNP genotype data are for the most part geared toward the use of diplotypes, rather than haplotypes, although the use of haplotypic values has been proposed. (Isik, Holland, Maltecca, 2016) In agriculture, genetic risk prediction is mostly geared towards selection of breeding stock on the basis of estimates of additive genetic values (that is, estimated breeding values) in the parent generation; the aim is to elicit average changes in the phenotype of the offspring generation.</description>

      <description>I n fact, as we noted before, Fisher ( 1 930, 1 958) went so far as to suggest that sexual reproduction is perhaps the only trait that has evolved by intergroup competition. (Crow, Kimura, 2009) The government went so far as to try to arrest opposition leaders. 政府竟然企图逮捕反对党领导人。 But one cannot go so far as to say that, in general, there is no real difference between asserting that it is &amp;ldquo;practically proved&amp;rdquo; that a man is the father and asserting that it is &amp;ldquo;practically proved&amp;rdquo; that he has the same phenotype as the father.</description>

      <description>These selected examples illustrate why a more holistic understanding of plant disease is needed to better understand beneficial interactions across the plant microbiome (Van der Putten et al., 2001). (Hacquard, Schadt, 2015) The most important innovation we need is holistic thinking about all of our resources. (Scientific American) The approach utilises a factor analytic (FA) model to capture the variance structure of the additive genotype-by-environment (A E) effects in a parsimonious and holistic manner and uses an approximate reduced animal model to overcome computational issues.</description>

      <description>The model did not improve upon the standard analysis when no differential shrinkage was applied with the model matching the performance of the standard SNP analysis when 2 &amp;lt; 0.01 (models S3.83.11, supplementary Table S3). (Pereira et al., 2017) The chapter concludes with an assessment of the molecular tools being developed for an integrated translational genomics program to improve upon present breeding and selection methodologies. (Hidalgo et al., 2010) To further improve upon this scheme, we have considered a mixed greedy algorithm that sequentially employs two different objective functions.</description>

      <description>In either case, care must be taken to evaluate the total effect of infusion to ensure that gains in some traits are not made at the inadvertent expense of other traits. (White, 1987) To avoid inadvertent negative selection for growth when selecting for high WUE, it is important to know if 13C and growth are genetically linked. (Brendel et al., 2002) The breeder can then take steps to ensure that inadvertent selection will not cause unwanted genetic changes in traits not measured, or at least minimize unfavorable responses.</description>

      <description> These four divergent theories of the origin of maize have stimulated research in an attempt to resolve the issue. (Hallauer et al., 2010) We then screened birds from elsewhere in the colony in an attempt to find the true father. (Burke, Bruford, 1987) This is reasonable, as one can borrow information from other observations in an attempt to predict the missing observation. (Walsh, Lynch, 2015)  </description>

      <description>The inexorable tendency for a mathematical function to approach some particular value (or set of values) with increasing n. (Beaumont, Rannala, 2004) The inexorable increase of relatedness in advanced-generation breeding populations coupled with the near-universal importance of inbreeding depression in forest trees (Chapter 5) means that management of inbreeding is a key issue in the development and implementation of all advanced-generation breeding programs. (White, Adams, Neale, 2007) Gaming of cross-border tax rules has risen inexorably.</description>

      <description>Such a model is useful in its own right for prediction of genotypic values in each generation. (Piepho et al., 2008) Because it is an important component of the breeder&amp;rsquo;s equation, a study of variation in the P matrix is also of importance in its own right, regardless of its possible use in place of G (Roff and Mousseau 2005). (Roff, 2007) In evolutionary biology, however, understanding the mechanisms causing the interactions is a research goal in its own right, which is facilitated by the trait-based approach.</description>

      <description> Selection in genetic tests frequently occurs at young ages in the interest of saving time (LAMBETH, 1980). (Doede, Adams, 1998) It is not shown here in the interest of space, but left as an exercise for the reader. (Stroup, 2012) It is rarely in the interest of those in the right to pretend that they are never wrong.  </description>

      <description>This was attributed to changes in the magnitude of the differences between subraces as well as changes in ranking at different sites. (Stackpole et al., 2010) For most scenarios, the genetic gain by the parent-balance strategy was in the magnitude of 65% of the grandparent-balance strategy with PGP at its optimum (Tabs.

      <description>ABSTRACT Complex quantitative traits of plants as measured on collections of genotypes across multiple environments are the outcome of processes that depend in intricate ways on genotype and environment simultaneously. (Boer et al., 2007) However, its analysis is traditionally intricate, unforgiving of unplanned missing information, and highly sensitive to imbalance, making the diallel unapproachable to many geneticists. (Lenarcic et al., 2012) It will be tempting to infer intricate (and incorrect) biological mechanisms to explain patterns that emerge following data analyses.</description>

      <description> There is mounting evidence on the chemical basis of many important wood quality traits. (Apiolaza, Luis, 2009) But if only weeds are considered (2455 widely spread species), the proportion mounts to 35.6%. (Levin, 2013) Natural epigenetic variation abounds, and detailed and refined descriptions of this variation are likely to mount quickly as higher throughput epigenetic profiling methods are applied.

      <description>In this way the less fertile stocks, having the social advantage, will gradually permeate the upper classes of society, and there cause the peculiar situation in which the more fortunate and successful of mankind have the smallest birth-rate.

      <description>The 20th century has seen an enormous output of different phylogenetic schemes and the persistence of grades has pervaded the methods of ``evolutionary systematics.&amp;rdquo; (Levin, 2013) Propelled by the genome projects and their spinoff technologies, QTL analyses have pervaded all fields of biology and form the backbone for the recent explosion of studies tying specific alleles to human disease. (Rik Kooke Erik Wijnker, 2012) Along with those discontinuous phase changes during development, there are continuous patterns of developmental transitions that pervade every aspect of growth and development at a wide range of organizational levels from cells to organs to the whole organisms (Poethig, 2003).</description>

      <description>When ungulate populations plummeted, populations of carnivores such as the lion (Panthera leo) crashed as well. (Levin, 2013) However, given the plummeting cost of NGS, in BOX 2 we consider when these methods, and perhaps genetic markers in general, might be superseded by whole-genome sequencing, and discuss the trade-offs between the two approaches for immediate projects. (Davey et al., 2011) The window around position 200-300 showed a relatively normal level of Ka (relative to the rest of the gene), while Ks plummeted dramatically, especially in the human-dog comparison.</description>

      <description>On the premise that many genes and the environment act and interact to determine the trait, founders recognized that it would be difficult if not impossible to determine the action of individual trait genes. Under this general premise, even the previous models of asynchrony of sexual maturity (section 7.1) and individual self-mating (chapter 5) can be conceived of as special cases of the present concept of mating predisposition. The premise behind these models is that environmental conditions are the primary determinant of realized species niches, and that the future preferred range distribution of species can be predicted by transferring the environmental parameters associated with the present distribution onto maps representing future climate scenarios (Pearson and Dawson 2003).</description>

      <description>Also, in some large factorial or disconnected half-diallel experiments, there are always some prescribed crosses that cannot be made or are very difficult to make owing to unavailability of mature ramets, insufficient flowers, poor pollen viability or poor mating success. (Wu, Matheson, 2001) Classical theory does not give a procedure for modifying the type1 error as a function of sample size, and the probability of this error is prescribed arbitrarily.</description>

      <description>This is due to the fact that the flowers were not emasculated prior to crosspollination (Gan and Sim 1987). (Carron, Aken, 1992) It was concluded that besides other operational advantages which are discussed, the Rigidimeter is a valuable tool for breeders to routinely evaluate and rank genotypes for stiffness prior to further selection. (Paques, Rozenberg, 2009) Although pollen production prior to 1976 was very sparse, 41% of the ramets used had by then initiated some seed cones.</description>

      <description>However, it is also relevant in part to selection for seed orchards, which may entail &amp;ldquo;backward&amp;rdquo; selection (progeny testing) and involve provisional selection at an earlier age than is asso- ciated with optimal t (cf. eq. 1), to be followed by roguing on later information, or to clonal forestry where, in addition, nonadditive gene effects become relevant. (Burdon, 1989) A limitation of this system is that the initial list of provisional candidates may not include the highest value individuals in the test since male GCA is known only for the provisional candidate list.</description>

      <description>The variation in sensitivity during different phases has been in fact proposed as a breeding goal to increase the duration of critical phases for yield determination at the expense of the duration of earlier phases (section 5). (Sadras, Calderini, 2014) It has been proposed that inbreeding depression may not always be a consequence of inbreeding in endangered populations. (Hoglund, 2009) The best linear u nbiased prediction (BLUP) method and ridge regression approaches have been proposed to estimate individual marker effects (Meuwissen et al.</description>

      <description>Spatial distance was left in even when be was not significant, since its variance was positive and collinearity between relatedness and spatial distance rendered the standard error estimates unreliable unless further measures were taken (see below). This will help to render a seed harvest more in line with the objectives of the breeding program, and which more readily meets the demands from forestry. The latter method has an even bigger limitation because the amount of harvested seed-cones is set by the least fecund parent and thus substantial amounts of potential reforestation material may be abandoned, rendering this method inappropriate from a practical perspective [294].</description>

      <description>These are significant rudiments to implement successful reforestation programs. (Burley, Evans, Youngquist, 2004) Male flowers have a rudimentary pistil with inconspicuous style and stigma, but they may also develop to the point that ovules, style, and stigma are well formed, and abnormality is restricted to incomplete development of the embryo sac. (Tuberosa, Graner, Frison, 2014) This is obtained generally from a previous rudimentary non-Bayesian analysis for each trait and the maximum among the traits can be considered.</description>

      <description>Older, senescent stands tend to exhibit a positive spatial dependence, which can be attributed to the weakening of competition after self-thinning, and the returning dominance of spatial micro-site effects. (Fox, Ades, Bi, 2001) In 2001 Campisi&amp;rsquo;s lab corroborated this idea with a groundbreaking study showing that senescent cells maintained in a culture dish can stimulate precancerous cells in the same culture to form unusually aggressive tumors when injected into mice.</description>

      <description>Now state-of-the-art computer simulations can successfully model billions of particles in a volume approaching the size of the observable universe. (Scientific American) Many of the ethical and social challenges confronting MalariaGEN stem from the diversity inherent in a large scientific enterprise with partners in rich and poor countries that span multiple disciplines, from clinical research and community-based research to state-of-the-art genomics and bioinformatics. (Natureinsight, 2009) A state-of-the-art procedure is described to examine the control patterns of specific QTLs on the origin, properties and functions of biological shape.</description>

      <description>Statistical issues stem from the choice of molecular marker type and marker set used, in addition to sampling strategy. (Wilson, Ferguson, 2002) For conifers, these limitations stem from the large, repetitive genomes that make gene cloning and chromosome walking very difficult (Neale and Williams 1991), and from the large physical distances between genetically mapped loci, probably exceeding 4000 kilobases per centimorgan (cf. (Strauss, Lande, Namkoong, 1992) Many of the applications and simplifications which stem from the definitions and concepts developed herein for groups or subdivisions of populations remain to be elaborated.</description>

      <description>They have been superseded by more sophisticated methods, often in the context of livestock data (Lynch &amp;amp; Walsh 1998; Sorensen &amp;amp; Gianola 2002), which have been further developed as computing power has increased. (Hill, 2010) Indeed, this finding suggests that a systematic gene-knockout programme could supersede association mapping strategies as a way of finding the genes that are involved in behaviour. (Natureinsight, 2009) However, given the plummeting cost of NGS, in BOX 2 we consider when these methods, and perhaps genetic markers in general, might be superseded by whole-genome sequencing, and discuss the trade-offs between the two approaches for immediate projects.</description>

      <description>While values of linkage disequilibrium, N and h2 can be proposed on relatively tangible grounds, the same cannot be said for the number of QTL controlling the traits under selection. (Grattapaglia, Resende, 2011) Studies on forest trees are able to follow successfully the methods applied in human, animal, and plant cytogenetic studies, but usually have not been pursued in depth, e.g., in an integrated long-term breeding and cytogenetic program with tangible objectives.</description>

      <description> When this correlation is positive the model is tantamount to fitting random cage effects, as discussed by Bijma et al. (2007) and Allen et al. (Cantet, Cappa, 2008) Sexual selection, in the original Darwinian sense, is tantamount to random mating of all types in one sex of a dioecious population, where the natural mating references are chosen in accordance with the frequencies of the types in this population.

      <description>Most of the early studies have used the linear mixed model (LMM) to analyze this type of data, assuming a Gaussian distribution (Gwaze et al. 1997), which is seldom tenable. (Weng et al., 2017) Therefore, a mixed model approach with environmental effects and GEI effects as random and with genotype effects as fixed is more tenable to fit MET data. (Saxton, 2014) While this assumption is not tenable in animal breeding, it is used frequently in biostatistics (Laird and Ware, 1982).</description>

      <description>Results of the Queensland work appear to enable the following tentative conclusions. (Carron, Aken, 1992) Thus, the data provide tentative support for recent claims that MLH is the preferred variable for detecting inbreeding depression under a wide variety of conditions (Slate et al. (Coltman, Slate, 2003) Finally, the tentative finding of a significant interaction between effects of genotype and site on MOE needs to be investigated further as this may profoundly influence models of wood quality for specific genotypes.</description>

      <description>When putative hybrid individuals were found in the field, the use of morphological traits deemed useful for artificial hybrids was not as definitive. (Kabrick et al., 2007) A less complicated method would be the use of morphological keys by which nursery staff could quickly differentiate the seedlings. (Carron, Aken, 1992) Genomic selection (GS) is the use of statistical methods to estimate the genetic merit of a genotyped animal based on prediction equations derived from large ancestral populations with both phenotypes and genotypes.</description>

      <description>However, the vast majority of seed orchards are clonal and on average consist of 30-50 different parents, each of which is represented by one or more vegetatively propagated units/copies, termed ramets. (Funda, El-Kassaby, 2012) As the vast majority of studies shows that deleterious recessive alleles, not overdominant alleles, are most important in causing ID (Crow 1993; Ritland 1996); selfing greatly increases the chance for these alleles to form homozygotes and, therefore, to be exposed to selection.</description>

      <description>The parents transferring their genes to the next breeding generation are therefore determined, to some extent, at the time of selection, but not at the time of the cross. (Vidal et al., 2017) Pollination mechanisms, or the structure of the ovule tip and the process by which pollen is taken into the micropyle, have been described to some extent for most maintain conelets of uniform development within a bag and on a tree.</description>

      <description>To this end several statistical methods that belong to the class known as assignment tests have been developed (Paetkau et al. (Hoglund, 2009) To this end, Bayesian approaches may provide superior means of incorporating issues which have rather been swept under the carpet to date, such as assessments of uncertainty, more complex statistical distributions or impacts of selection (Hadfield 2008; Ovaskainen et al. (Kruuk, Hill, 2008) Currently, two wellestablished but inefficient routes to this end are based on mature and widely available technologies.</description>

      <description>In particular, functional mapping capitalizes on statistical modeling of the covariance structure based on autoregressive (AR) and structured antedependence (SAD) processes and, thus, makes a longitudinal high-dimensional problem computationally tractable. (Wu, Yang, Wu, 2007) To date maternal effects have been the most widely studied form of IGE (McAdam et al., 2014), but rapid development of theory and statistically tractable models (Bijma et al., 2007; Bijma and Wade, 2008) means that the IGE framework will increasingly be used to model the quantitative genetics of social interactions.</description>
